# Hey There!

My name is Salil Ketkar and I am a student in the Data Science program with Thinkful.  A little background on me:  I'm a data scientist with a background in environmental engineering.  Currently I am located in San Diego but have a growing interest in the data science market in San Francisco and even abroad in Europe.  

This repository contains assignments and challenges from my 6 month Data Science program with Thinkful.  The other repositories contain milestone projects that were completed or are currently being worked on.
